Shear-dependent viscosities have been measured over a range of temperature and pressure
for seven engine oils blended to have kinematic viscosity of 14 mm2/s at 100 C with two
base oils and four viscosity modifiers. Elevated pressure measurements were performed
with a pressurized thin-film Couette viscometer and ambient pressure measurements were
done with a PCS USV viscometer. These measurements were fitted to a generalized Newtonian
model with the effective shear modulus specified by an empirical power-law shifting
rule. The use of PAO-40 as a thickener delayed the shear-thinning to very high stress as
compared with the polymers. The rate sensitivity of the oils thickened with nondispersant
polymers was similar. Like the Tannas TBS viscometer, the PCS Instruments USV viscometer
provides shear-dependent viscosity measurements, which can be essential for the most
accurate time-temperature-pressure shifting. Viscosities measured at high viscous power
in the ambient pressure viscometer, however, tend to be influenced by thermal softening
and at high stress by shear cavitation.

	<Introduction>
		The study of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) has
		evolved rapidly in the last eight years [1–4] through the incorporation
		of realistic rheology, obtained from viscometers, into EHL
		analysis. Discoveries are now made through analysis before experimental
		observation [5–7]. There is now a successful formula
		for the prediction of EHL film thickness for polymer thickened
		oils [8]. Previously the use of viscometers to characterize the
		shear dependence of viscosity was considered to be controversial
		[9]. It should be possible to apply the same successful principles
		to hydrodynamic lubrication [10].
	</Introduction>
	<Introduction>
		The time-temperature-pressure superposition (TTPS) principle,
		or the method of reduced variables, is an essential part of quantitative
		elastohydrodynamics where the temporary shear dependence
		of the viscosity or shear-thinning of the liquid must be known.
		Pressure shifting is obviously a requirement for any lubrication
		application because for a bearing supporting a load the liquid film
		must operate at elevated pressure. Measurements of the shearthinning
		may be made at experimentally convenient conditions of
		temperature, pressure and shear rate with confidence that the information
		gained is relevant to the conditions in the lubricating
		film of an operating bearing or concentrated contact. Were it not
		for TTPS it would not be possible to make predictions of film
		thickness and friction under severe conditions because the
		required properties could only be obtained under conditions for
		which they would be hopelessly intertwined with thermal effects.
		Tanner [11] presents an engineering based discussion of TTPS.
		Although TTPS can also be used to calculate the normal stress differences
		in steady shear, only the application of TTPS to shear
		thinning viscosity is addressed here.
	</Introduction>
	<Introduction>
		The viscosity of polymer solutions may vary with shear stress
		(or shear rate) as a result of alignment and stretching of the polymer
		molecule, resulting in a temporary reduction in viscosity
		known as shear-thinning. Viscosity may also be permanently
		reduced due to high shear stress by the breaking of chemical
		bonds known as degradation. Both phenomena have been
		observed in the pressurized Couette viscometers [12] which are
		employed in this work. The study of non-Newtonian behavior of
		lubricants has a troubled history in tribology. The thermalsoftening
		which results from the increase of temperature due to
		viscous dissipation is not shear-thinning as has been occasionally
		asserted [13] in the tribology literature. The association of shearthinning
		with high rate of shear rather than high shear stress may
		have originated with this mistaken notion. Indeed, the acceptance
		of a realistic explanation for traction in EHL was delayed by decades
		due to the insistence on modeling non-Newtonian response
		with the sinh-law, an expression known for eighty years to have
		resulted from viscous heating in viscometers [14]. In addition,
		shear cavitation, which occurs in viscometers at ambient pressure
		[1,10], can be mistaken for either shear-thinning or degradation.
	</Introduction>
	<Introduction>
		In this article, two different viscometers operating over very
		different levels of viscosity and pressure are used to establish the
		TTPS shifting rules for seven polymer thickened engine oils formulated
		for kinematic viscosity of 14 mm2/s at 100 C.
	</Introduction>
	<Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
		Flow curves of the logarithm of viscosity plotted against the
		logarithm of shear stress can be made to superimpose by shifting
		along a path that is vertical or nearly so. There are many other
		ways to illustrate the superposition; however, for lubrication problems
		the presentation of viscosity, g, versus shear stress, s, on logarithmic
		scales is most useful. Superposition is illustrated in Fig. 1
		for the standard reference material SRM2490 a solution of polyisobutylene
		in pristane. NIST certified viscosities [15] at ambient
		pressure and viscosities measured in a pressurized Couette viscometer
		at pressure of 2 MPa are plotted, normalized by the limiting
		low shear viscosity, l. The pressurized Couette data from
		Georgia Tech were generated with a single revolution of copper
		alloy cylinders with 11 lm gap. Not only is there agreement
		between the two data sets, but vertical shifting has resulted in a
		compact master curve. The small elevated pressure employed for
		the present data will not significantly affect the viscosity but will
		prevent cavitation bubbles which will form at ambient pressure
		for stress greater than about 4 kPa given the non-Newtonian
		character of the polymer solution [16]. Also, this standard reference
		material will degrade for shear stress greater than about
		7 kPa [12]. The inflection in the flow curve of Fig. 1 requires that
		a second Newtonian viscosity be included as a fitting parameter;
		however, a second Newtonian plateau of constant viscosity rarely
		appears since most often the polymer will degrade or the base oil
		will shear-thin before the viscosity levels out.
	</Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
	<Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
		The generalized viscosity function shown in Fig. 1 as the curve
		is an approximation to Carreau-Yasuda [17] which gives the
		viscosity as a function of shear stress rather than shear rate.
	</Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
	<Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
		Here, the effective shear modulus is G¼450 Pa, the power-law
		exponent is n¼0.26, the Yasuda parameter is a¼1.3, and the second
		Newtonian viscosity is defined by l2/l¼0.0063. This form
		for the viscosity function will be used throughout this article
		although there are many such expressions available [12].
	</Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
	<Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
		Another method to produce a master curve [18] yields viscosity
		as a function of rate by expressing a reduced viscosity, g=aTp, as a
		function of reduced shear rate, aTp _ c, where the shift factor is
		aTp ¼ lðT; pÞ=lðTR; pRÞ and TR and pR are a reference temperature
		and pressure, respectively. This is equivalent to the shifting
		shown in Fig. 1, although the shape of the master curve is, of
		course, different because the independent variables are different.
		This is the simplest shifting rule, where G¼GR is constant, also
		known as the Vinogradov-Malkin shifting rule [19].
	</Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
	<Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
		A shifting rule based upon molecular kinetic theory [18] is the
		Ferry rule [19], for which G ¼ GRðqTÞ=ðqRTRÞ. This rule, however,
		predicts that G will increase with temperature, an effect not
		ordinarily confirmed by experiment. If the low shear viscosity
		varies by many orders-of-magnitude due to variations in pressure,
		a different shifting rule has been found to be useful [20,21].

		with 0m0.3. If m¼0, the Vinogradov-Malkin rule results.
		Here, it is arbitrarily chosen that lR¼10 Pas. The choice of shifting
		rule has been shown to have a small effect on the calculated
		film thickness in EHL [22].
	</Time-Temperature-Pressure_Superposition>
	<Viscometers>
		The primary viscometer used in this investigation is the thinfilm
		pressurized Couette viscometer in the Center for High Pressure
		Rheology, Georgia Tech shown in Fig. 2. This instrument is
		the last in a series of six developed to measure viscosity versus
		shear stress to sufficient shear stress for the observation of sheardependence
		in lubricant base oils. It has been described in fine
		detail in Ref. [12]. Briefly, the outer cylinder of a cylinder set is
		restrained by a torque sensor while the inner cylinder is rotated
		through one revolution by a stepper motor outside of the pressure
		vessel. The cylinders are constructed from dispersionstrengthened
		copper for high thermal conductivity and strength.
		The gap is less than 5 lm for the high stress measurements to follow
		resulting in a low Nahme-Griffith number [23] flow. A low
		Nahme-Griffith number implies a low thermal feedback in the viscometer.
		Calibration of the gap is performed with a reference
		liquid, diisodecyl phthalate, which is Newtonian to relatively high
		stress. The usefulness of this instrument for lubricant analysis has
		been proven through many examples of quantitative predictions of
		film thickness and friction [1–8] and measurements of mechanical
		degradation [12]. While it is possible to perform these measurements
		to 1 GPa [12] using a simpler viscometer, the Ferry shifting
		rule has been validated to this pressure [12] making possible the
		extrapolation from these lower pressures.
	</Viscometers>
	<Viscometers>
		The low-shear viscosities for elevated pressures were measured
		with a falling cylinder viscometer [24] using a hollow sinker
		which applies a shear stress of 45 Pa.
	</Viscometers>
	<Viscometers>
		In a previous report [25], the shifting rule was determined for a
		gear oil to be m¼0 from the superposition of data from the pressurized
		Couette viscometer at pressure up to 500 MPa and 38 C
		and data from a Tannas TBS viscometer [26] at ambient pressure
		and 150 C. The viscosity in that case varied from 0.005 to
		26 Pas. In this work a different ambient pressure viscometer, the
		PCS Instruments ultra-shear viscometer (USV), has been
		employed. The operating principles of this instrument are
		described in Ref. [27]. This instrument, like the TBS, is restricted
		to ambient pressure.
	</Viscometers>
	<Viscometers>
		The low-shear viscosities for ambient pressure were measured
		with a capillary viscometer, Cannon CAV2000 [28]. The precise
		shear stress is unknown but is usually of the order of 1 Pa.
	</Viscometers>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		Seven samples were blended to have kinematic viscosity of 14
		mm2/s at 100 C with an additive package, which is standard for
		engine oils, exclusive of the polymer thickener. They are
		described in Table 1. The polymer thickeners, SBR, PMA, and
		OCP are Styrene Butadiene, Polymethacrylate and Olefin Copolymer,
		respectively. Two samples were thickened with a 40 mm2/s
		at 100 C polyalphaolefin (PAO-40). Commercially available viscosity
		modifiers were used in the study. Molecular structure and
		other properties of these polymers are proprietary to the viscosity
		modifier manufacturers. A nominal base oil kinematic viscosity of
		4 mm2/s at 100 C and varying concentrations of viscosity modifiers
		were used to reach the blend viscosity of 14 mm2/s at 100 C.

	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		Flow curves are shown in Fig. 3 through 9. Five samples, 644,
		645, 646, 647, and 648, displayed an inflection within the
		measured interval of shear stress which requires a second Newtonian
		viscosity. One sample, 649, yielded a rate sensitivity coefficient,
		n ¼ @ ln s=@ ln _ c, very close to unity as shown in Fig. 8.
		Such weak shear-thinning will usually not result in an inflection
		since low viscosity base oils will shear-thin above a stress of
		about 5 MPa. One sample, 650 shown in Fig. 9, showed no significant
		departure from Newtonian response until the stress exceeded
		about 500 kPa at elevated pressures. A smaller cylinder set made
		of tungsten-copper composite was used to generate the flow
		curves in Fig. 9 for l>40 Pas.

	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		Equations (1) and (2) were graphically fitted to all data resulting
		in the parameters listed in Table 2. The standard deviation of
		relative viscosity, excluding certain USV data, was generally 4%.
		The parameter, a, sets the width of the transition from the first
		Newtonian plateau to the shear-thinning regime. The smaller
		value of a was required for 650 due to a rather broad transition
		which is a characteristic of blended base oils [1]. For l2/l>0.03,
		n 6¼ n [8]. Therefore, the rate sensitivity coefficient has been
		evaluated at the inflection and entered in Table 2 for all except
		650. There was insufficient stress applied in the measurement for
		650 to observe the fully-developed power-law response. The data
		from the USV viscometer at ambient pressure was essential for
		the estimation of the TTPS shifting exponent, m, since the elevated
		pressure data did not cover a sufficiently large interval of
		viscosity to accurately establish the variation in G. It was not possible
		to evaluate m for sample 650 since the transition to shearthinning
		was due to the PAO-40 only and as such the stress
		exceeded the capability of the ambient pressure viscometer.
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		Referring to Figs. 3 through 6, there is a significant departure
		from the constitutive relation (1) for the data generated by the
		USV viscometer when the viscous power, U¼s2/g, exceeds about
		21011W/m3. The origin of this departure can be investigated by
		an estimation of the temperature rise, T0, of the working surfaces
		of the cylinders for the conditions of the circled data points in
		Fig. 4 which correspond to similar stresses. A lower limit for T0
		can be found from a calculation of the surface temperature of a
		semi-infinite solid with constant heat flux into the surface, Uh/2,
		assuming the measured viscosity applies for the entire time of
		shear, t. The solution from Carslaw and Jaeger [29] is
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of the cylinders
		are k and j, respectively and are listed with the properties of the
		cylinder sets for the two viscometers in Table 3. The viscous
		power and temperature rise are shown in Table 3. Including thermal
		feedback would result in a decrease of the temperature; however,
		including the finite thickness of the cylinders would increase
		the temperature. The much greater viscous power is primarily responsible
		for the large temperature rise in the USV viscometer.
		Warrens and coworkers [30] found thermal softening effects in
		the USV for U>31011W/m3.
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		The temperature-viscosity coefficient for 645 at ambient pressure
		and 50 C is b¼0.036K1. For a rate controlled process,
		@ ln g=@T ¼ bðn þ m  nmÞ ¼ 0:031K1 [12]. The estimated
		temperature rise for the USV would, therefore, result in a 21%
		decrease in viscosity. The measured viscosity is 23% less than the
		prediction of Eq. (2) indicating that viscous heating is primarily
		responsible for the departure. There is, however, a second nonconstitutive
		process at work in Figs. 8 and 9.
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		Shear cavitation occurs when a tensile stress appears in a
sheared liquid. Cavitation bubbles first appear for shear stress satisfying
the principle normal stress criterion [16]
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Viscosity_Measurements>
		For a Newtonian liquid, cavitation occurs when s>p. For non-
		Newtonian liquids the approximation N12s2/G for the first normal
		stress difference is useful. In Figs. 8 and 9, the stress in the
		USV viscometer momentarily exceeds the ambient pressure
		(100 kPa). Thereafter, for increased shear rate, the stress saturates
		at slightly more than 1 atmosphere. This is the shear cavitation
		first explained 26 years ago [31]. Bubbles increase viscosity at
		low stress and reduce viscosity at high stress. Equation (4) predicts
		that bubbles will appear for s>10 kPa and 50 kPa for 649
		and 650, respectively, and at lower stress for all other samples.
		Apparently the short time of shear, 40 ms, for the USV viscometer
		does not allow for significant nucleation and grow of cavitation
		bubbles until the cavitation results in liquid failure; however,
		since cavitation bubbles can persist for more than one hour [16],
		repeated shearing is likely to result in a measureable loss in viscosity
		which can be confused with degradation.
	</Viscosity_Measurements>
	<Discussion>
		The weak shear-thinning, n*¼0.95, of sample 649 results from
		the contribution of the dispersant additive alone and the relatively
		large effective modulus of 650, G¼1500 kPa, is caused by the
		shear dependence of the PAO-40 thickener which is present in
		649, as well. If the flow curves for 649 had been extended with
		the smaller, high-stress cylinder set, it is expected that the sheardependence
		of the PAO-40 would also appear. For neat PAO-40,
		G¼6000 kPa and n¼0.4 [12].
	</Discussion>
	<Discussion>
		Comparing sample 644 with 648, the dispersant form of OCP
		results in a reduction of n* and GR over the nondispersant form.
		Comparing 646 with 647, the use of PAO base oil with PMA
		reduces GR and m over the mineral base oil. The various polymer
		thickeners, SBR, PMA and OCP in PAO may be compared
		through samples 645, 646, and 647. PMA yields the greatest value
		of GR and OCP the smallest value of l2/l. Among all the polymers
		in PAO, n* is similar.
	</Discussion>
	<Discussion>
		Like the Tannas TBS viscometer, the PCS USV viscometer provides
		shear-dependent viscosity measurements which can be
		essential for the most accurate TTPS shifting. However, care must
		be taken in the interpretation of data from this viscometer as viscosities
		measured at high viscous power tend to be influenced by
		thermal softening [26] and at high stress by shear cavitation. For
		sample 649, the data most useful for interpretation of shearthinning
		were above the manufacturer stated viscosity range of 20
		mPas [32].
	</Discussion>
	<Discussion>
		Mechanical degradation in a Couette viscometer presents as a
		viscosity measurement which cannot be repeated following shearing
		at higher stress [12,33]. Each sample was subjected to shear
		stress in excess of 100 kPa for at least 10 s. There was no loss in
		repeatability after the shearing at high stress. Therefore, degradation
		did not occur and is not expected for stress up to at least
		100 kPa.
	</Discussion>
	<Discussion>
		The viscosity ratio, l2/l, was adjusted to visually fit the inflection
		in the viscosity data. This process was aided by forty years of
		experience in interpreting flow curves for polymer blended oils.
		When similar flow curves for high molecular base oils such as
		reported in Ref. [34] are compared with these, the inflection
		becomes obvious as it is absent from those for base oils. The constitutive
		modeling presented here was tested for oil 647 by measuring
		the rolling central film thickness in EHL by interferometry
		as shown in Fig. 10. Temperature was 100 C and the Hertz pressure
		was 0.5 GPa. Employing the parameters of Table 2 with G
		calculated from Eq. (2) for the average inlet pressure, resulted in
		good agreement with the measured film thickness using the formula
		from Ref. [8]. The accuracy of the prediction was substantially
		degraded by increasing or decreasing the viscosity ratio by
		20%. The capability to predict shear-thinned film thickness for
		temperature very different from the viscosity measurements
		attests to the utility of TTPS.
